# CODE QUIZ

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a functional coding quiz that asks basic questions in regard to js, css, and html. Once the quiz starts, users will be on a timer to answer as many questions as possible. Correct answers add to their score while incorrect answers reduce their time. Once time reaches zero, the quiz is over and the user can submit their score with their initials to a scoreboard
